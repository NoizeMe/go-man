# go-man
A manager for Go SDK installations.

Many other language have small helper tools that help to manage one or many installations of the SDK required to develop in
that language. Popular examples are [sdkman](https://sdkman.io/) for Java, [rvm](https://rvm.io/) for Ruby or
[nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) for Node.js. go-man aims to provide a similar feature for Go developers.
