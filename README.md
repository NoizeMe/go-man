Many other language have small helper tools that help to manage one or many installations of the SDK required to develop in
that language. Popular examples are [sdkman](https://sdkman.io/) for Java, [rvm](https://rvm.io/) for Ruby or
[nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) for Node.js. go-man aims to provide a similar feature for Go developers.
